Where are we now?
The genetic algorithm is not powerful enough to change node, if some node is not selected at all it will not become available.
Is genetic algorithm really the best algorithm then?
If yes, then we need a better initial algorithm.
The current system is too homogeneous.
Can we make it more heterogenous?
Maybe by varying the maximum temperature (significantly).
Should consider what solution would be the optimal and see how we can come up with a stochastic algorithm to approximate this.

Suggestion:
Find all permutations for minimum number of nodes to satisfy temperature constraint and schedule all tasks.
Evenly distribute all tasks on each of these permutations, place these as the top chromosomes in the population.
